    "## Detailed Introduction to Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scientific Method\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Steps**:\n",
    "   - Asking questions, conducting research, forming hypotheses, and testing them.\n",
    "   - If the hypothesis aligns with the results, the process is validated; otherwise, adjust the hypothesis (new question, new hypothesis).\n",
    "   - Communication of results is essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Machine Learning as Hypothesis Testing**:\n",
    "   - Every ML model is essentially a hypothesis about how data can be modeled.\n",
    "   - This makes the entire process iterative and research-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Applied Machine Learning Process (OSEMN)**:\n",
    "   - *Obtain* data, *Scrub* it (clean and preprocess), *Explore* for patterns, *Model* to make predictions, and *INterpret* results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Machine Learning Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Machine learning is the process by which a computer learns from data and experience, using a loss function to minimize errors and metrics to evaluate performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised Learning\n",
    "1. We compare predicted outputs $\\tilde{y}$ with real outcomes $y$.\n",
    "2. The goal is to minimize the difference between $\\tilde{y}$ and $y$:\n",
    "   $$ \\text{Loss Function} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum (\\tilde{y} - y)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "1. No labeled outcomes $y$, only input data $X$.\n",
    "2. The goal is to segment data into meaningful clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "1. A program continuously learns by interacting with its environment.\n",
    "2. It adapts based on rewards or penalties to optimize outcomes.\n",
    "3. Often a combination between Supervised and Unsupervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Pitfalls\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gradient descent is a greedy algorithm used to minimize the error in a model, searching for local minima. It works iteratively to adjust the model's parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function:\n",
    "   $$ \\theta_{\\text{new}} = \\theta_{\\text{old}} - \\eta \\cdot \\nabla J(\\theta) $$\n",
    "   where $\\eta$ is the learning rate and $\\nabla J(\\theta)$ is the gradient of the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reproducibility\n",
    "1. Ensure that experiments can be repeated by documenting every step in data handling and modeling.\n",
